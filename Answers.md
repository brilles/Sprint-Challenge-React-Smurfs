1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Differences between client-side routing and server-side routing include where state is handled, speed, and refreshing. Client side routing handles state on the browser and is usually faster than server side routing because only particular pieces of the DOM are rendered during a view change. This is modern approach can be better because it requires less server requests but it can have a downside of loading a bit slower on the initial page load. Client-side routing doesnâ€™t require a page reload on page change whereas server side does.
